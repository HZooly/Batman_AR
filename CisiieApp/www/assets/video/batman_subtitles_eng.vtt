00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000 D:vertical A:start
Left in ruins by Batman final showdown with
a Titan-enhanced Joker, Arkham Asylum is deemed

2
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000 A:start
no longer capable of housing the criminals
of Gotham City by its newly appointed mayor

3
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000 A:end
and ex-warden of Arkham Asylum, Quincy Sharp.
The brother-sister crime duo known as T&amp;T,

4
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
also jacked on Titan, make an attack on City
Hall, and when they're thwarted by good ol

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Batman, they resort to blowing themselves
up. Titan is a nasty drug.

6
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
With Gotham City hall demolished and the populace
in panic, Quincy Sharp takes this opportunity

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
to declare martial law and reveal his plans
for Arkham City. Sharp plans to wall off

8
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
half of the city to house criminals in an
open-air detention facility, which effectively

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
makes half of Gotham a playground for Batman's
enemies.

10
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Mayor Quincy Sharp - wicked mastermind, you
ask? Not so, as he's merely a puppet for an

11
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
evil psychiatrist.

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Enter Hugo Strange - Arkham Asylum's resident
psychiatrist and sinister architect of the

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Arkham City Project. His deranged obsession
with Batman has led him to believe Bruce Wayne

14
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and the Bat are one and the same. Strange,
having set the stage for chaos, wields absolute

15
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000 L:12%
power in politics and crime alike and now
sets his sights on the Batman.

16
00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.000 L:75%
Have fun!
