00:00:00 --> 00:00:04
Left in ruins by Batman&#39;s final showdown with
a Titan-enhanced Joker, Arkham Asylum is deemed

3
00:00:04 --> 00:00:07
no longer capable of housing the criminals
of Gotham City by its newly appointed mayor

4
00:00:07 --> 00:00:11
and ex-warden of Arkham Asylum, Quincy Sharp.
The brother-sister crime duo known as T&amp;T,

5
00:00:11 --> 00:00:14
also jacked on Titan, make an attack on City
Hall, and when they&#39;re thwarted by good &#39;ol

6
00:00:14 --> 00:00:18
Batman, they resort to blowing themselves
up. Titan is a nasty drug.

7
00:00:18 --> 00:00:21
With Gotham City hall demolished and the populace
in panic, Quincy Sharp takes this opportunity

8
00:00:21 --> 00:00:25
to declare martial law and reveal his plans
for &#39;Arkham City.&#39; Sharp plans to wall off

9
00:00:25 --> 00:00:28
half of the city to house criminals in an
open-air detention facility, which effectively

10
00:00:28 --> 00:00:30
makes half of Gotham a playground for Batman&#39;s
enemies.


11
00:00:30 --> 00:00:33
Mayor Quincy Sharp - wicked mastermind, you
ask? Not so, as he&#39;s merely a puppet for an

12
00:00:33 --> 00:00:34
evil psychiatrist.

13
00:00:34 --> 00:00:38
Enter Hugo Strange - Arkham Asylum&#39;s resident
psychiatrist and sinister architect of the

14
00:00:38 --> 00:00:41
Arkham City Project. His deranged obsession
with Batman has led him to believe Bruce Wayne

15
00:00:41 --> 00:00:45
and the Bat are one and the same. Strange,
having set the stage for chaos, wields absolute

16
00:00:45 --> 00:00:49
power in politics and crime alike and now
sets his sights on the Batman.

17
00:00:49 --> 00:00:49
Have fun!
